  Collection of tests for the ChatGPT integration service.
  
  This collection tests the ChatGPT service functionality including:
  - Service availability check
  - Simple message sending
  - Conversation handling
  - Bot response generation
  - Integration with the bot mention system
  
  **Setup Requirements:**
  1. Set the OPENAI_API_KEY environment variable
  2. Make sure the server is running on localhost:4000
  3. Ensure the database has test data (bots and channels)
  
  **Environment Variable:**
  Add to your .env file:
  ```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
  ```
  
  **Test Order Recommendation:**
  1. Check ChatGPT Status - Verify service availability
  2. Send Simple Message - Test basic functionality
  3. Generate Bot Response - Test bot-specific responses
  4. Send Conversation - Test multi-turn conversations
  5. Test Bot Mention - Test complete integration
  
  **Note:** Tests 2-4 will fail if OPENAI_API_KEY is not configured, but the bot mention test should still work with fallback responses.
